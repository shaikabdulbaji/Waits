	4.Conditional and Unconditional Synchronization in Selenium WebDriver.


	•It is a mechanism which involves more than one components to work parallel with Each other.

	Generally in Test Automation, we have two components
	1. Application Under Test.
	2. Test Automation Tool.

	•Both these components will have their own speed. We should write our scripts in such a way that both the components should move with same and desired speed, so that we will not encounter "Element Not Found" errors which will consume time again in debugging.
	•It is a process of coordinating or matching two or more activities/devices/processes in time.
	•Process of matching the speed of AUT(Application under test) & Test tool in order to get proper execution.
	•During the test execution Test tool gives instructions one by one with same speed, but AUT takes less time for some steps execution and more time for some steps execution, in order to keep them in sync then Synchronization is required.
	•Whenever any step required time more than Synchronization time for execution, then Synchronization is required.
